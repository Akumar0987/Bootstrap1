        <h3>What Am I?</h3>
        <p>The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera native to Africa and India. It has a muscular,
            deep-chested body, short, rounded head, round ears, and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail. It is sexually
            dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than females and have a prominent mane. It is a social species,
            forming groups called prides. A lion's pride consists of a few adult males, related females, and cubs.
            Groups of female lions usually hunt together, preying mostly on large ungulates. The lion is an apex and
            keystone predator; although some lions scavenge when opportunities occur and have been known to hunt humans,
            the species typically does not.</p>

        <h3>Where To Find Me?</h3>
        <p>Nearly all wild lions live in Africa, below the Sahara Desert, but one small population exists around Gir
            Forest National Park in western India. Lions in west and central Africa are more closely related to these
            Asiatic lions in India, than to those found in southern and east Africa.</p>
